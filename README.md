# sd-webui-e621-prompt

Request tags of an image from e621, inspired by [`sd-webui-gelbooru-prompt`](https://github.com/antis0007/sd-webui-gelbooru-prompt).

**Note**: I'm not a Python developer and haven't touched this language for a few years. This extension was hacked together using some other sd-webui extensions sources, stackoverflow answers and pure luck. Feel free to submit PR's fixing this unholy mess.

## Features

- Extract tags from e621 link, post id or md5 hash
- Drag and drop saved images to calculate their md5 automatically
- Configurable prefixes for tag categories (species, character, artist, etc)
- Replace underscores with spaces. Or not.
- Exclude unwanted tags
- Append wanted tags
- Connect to e621 via proxy, for more... "special" parts of the world

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- sd-webui v1.3.2 (may work with the previous versions, but untested)

## Development

1. Clone into `extensions` folder
2. `cp .env.example .env` for setting `PYTHONPATH`. It is required for IDE autocompletions to work (tested with vscode, if you use PyCharm your mileage may vary). If you using unix-like OS, replace semicolon with a colon

## Something wrong?

Open an issue on Github if there is some weird error, or use Discussions tab for general questions.

Please adhere to the Github TOS and **do not post** any NSFW imagery or tags in the issues or discussions.

## How to change categories, selected by default

1. Reset form
2. Refresh browser window
3. Select needed categories in the order you want them to appear in the final result
4. Navigate to "Settings" -> "Defaults"
5. Verify that only "Categories" field is updated
6. Apply and restart sd-webui (not required, but preferred)
